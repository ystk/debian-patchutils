  - dehtmldiff extracts a diff from an HTML page
  - filterdiff extracts or excludes diffs from a diff file
  - fixcvsdiff fixes diff files created by CVS that "patch" mis-interprets
  - flipdiff exchanges the order of two patches
  - grepdiff shows which files are modified by a patch matching a regex
  - interdiff shows differences between two unified diff files
  - lsdiff shows which files are modified by a patch
  - recountdiff recomputes counts and offsets in unified context diffs
  - rediff and editdiff fix offsets and counts of a hand-edited diff
  - splitdiff separates out incremental patches
