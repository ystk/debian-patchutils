Patchutils news
---------------

0.3.3 (stable)

	Context output format for "no newline" lines has been fixed.
	The splitdiff utility now has an option to disable ".patch"
	filename extensions. Some fixes for bugs spotted by
	Coverity. Interdiff can now use "-" (stdin) for one of the
	inputs.

0.3.2 (stable)

	Interdiff had previously been putting absolute filenames in
	the input to the patch program.  It now avoids doing this.
	Editdiff no longer runs rediff when no changes were made in
	the editor.  The correct exit status is now set when the
	decompress option fails.  A temporary file leak has been
	fixed.  The documentation has been updated.

0.3.0 (stable)

	The lsdiff -H option is now the default, and new options have
	been added to filterdiff for reading inclusion/exclusion
	patterns from files, and for removing non-diff lines.
